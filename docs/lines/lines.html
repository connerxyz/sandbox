# lines

This piece was created while I was participating in [Genuary 2020](https://genuary.art/). The prompt was "lines", and
I immediately began to think across lines of text and historical context.

*Lines combines lines of text from the transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Zelensky at
the heart of the scandal with lines of text from the US Constitution, together with images of Trump encoded as ASCII
art.*

At the time, the Trump presidency and it's battle-lines dominated dominated headlines. There had been
talk of a "constitutional crisis" and impeachment since Trump took office three years before. And yet, he seemed somehow
untouchable. The upcoming 2020 US Presidential election was just around the corner. It
all felt noisy and hostile. No one was sure what would happen.*

Whenever I see this piece, I'm reminded that in just a few months, the COVID pandemic would collide
with everything – including Trump's presidency and the 2020 election – to even more thoroughly dominant
the zeitgeist.

*\* It had already been years of brutal political scandal involving Russia and election meddling, and the [Trump-Ukraine
scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump%E2%80%93Ukraine_scandal) specifically was just reaching full-tilt. The
allegation was that Trump wouldn't provide the Ukrainian government $400 million of military aide to fight off a
Russian invasion unless they opened a criminal investigation into Joe Biden and his son. Articles of impeachment had
been filed against Trump. He was acquitted. Again, Trump was somehow untouchable; another "constitutional crisis".*
