<h1>MinneHack</h1>
<p><strong>MinneHack is an annual, Minneapolis based hackathon I co-founded in 2014.</strong> I was responsible for event management,
sponsor relations, online presence, branding, marketing, and also performed as emcee.</p>
<!--<img style="width:100%;" src="/minnehack/img/minnehack-stats-101.psd.png" data-action="zoom"/>-->

<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>The event quickly grew into the <strong>largest regional hackathon</strong>, attracting participants from <strong>across the United
States</strong> and even <strong>internationally</strong>. We drew attendance by doing things like making it <strong>100% free to attend, including
transportation</strong>.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%;" src="./minnehack_files/minnehack.macbook.mockup.png" data-action="zoom"></p>
<h2>Partnership</h2>
<p>The <strong>many <a href="https://www.startribune.com/why-do-so-many-fortune-500-companies-call-minnesota-home/561251031/">Fortune 500
companies</a> headquartered in the Twin
Cities</strong>, combined with the students we
brought in from across geographies, produced opportunities to <strong>showcase talent</strong> and <strong>forge new
careers</strong>.</p>
<p>Our sponsors included local companies like <strong>Target, Best Buy, Optum,</strong> but also <strong>Microsoft, Google, Dell</strong> –
and <strong>many others</strong>.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%;" src="./minnehack_files/minnehack.logo.list.png" data-action="zoom"></p>
<h2>Success</h2>
<p>We <strong>set everyone up for success</strong> by getting hackers <strong>solving real problems</strong> that were <strong>relevant to sponsors' businesses</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Many hackathon competitions fail because they're left too open-ended</strong>. With only 24
hours to build, teams spend too much time ideating instead of building. Those that do
get something built often struggle to explain their applications' value proposition. Everyone
is left wondering... <em>what's the point of all this?</em></p>
<p><strong>We made sure MinneHack was different by aligning everyone around event prompts.</strong> We worked with our sponsors to
create <strong>well defined event prompts</strong> that often incorporated APIs, data, and/or hardware <strong>provided by our sponsors</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This formula was a great success</strong>: sponsors became truly <strong>invested event partners</strong>, the prompts kept teams
<strong>focused and productive</strong>, while ensuring our sponsors got to see <strong>a wide range of
experimentation produced using their own assets</strong>.</p>
<p><img style="width:100%;" src="./minnehack_files/minnehack.photocollage02.png" data-action="zoom"></p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>In the three years I was involved with the event, <strong>MinneHack brought together 3,000+ engineers and designers from
50+ Universities and Colleges across 25 states together with more than 50+ industry sponsors</strong>. It was an incredible
opportunity to <strong>bring together builders and businesses</strong> through <strong>competition and partnership</strong>.</p>
