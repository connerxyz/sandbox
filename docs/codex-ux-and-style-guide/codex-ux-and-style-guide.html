# Codex

Codex is an app for building and exploring personal knowledge graphs using digital artifacts, like text, images, and video.
What its inventor, Iian Neil, calls a knowledge worker's operating system. Here's how we went about discovering a brand and visual identity for Codex.

<!-- ## A potential standout among the crowd

Iian and I had both been active in knowledge management for many years before we met. Iian for example developed a
WYSIWYG text-editor that used a novel [standoff markup](https://tei-c.org/Vault/Workgroups/SO/sow06.html) format designed to [work well with graph databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlapping_markup#Graph-based_formalisms). He had begun to mature this work into something he was tweeting about called Codex, which is how we first connected. 

Personal knowledge management (PKM) tools like Notion, Roam, and Obsidian were becoming very popular at the time. But Iian and I felt there was still something missing from the markplace, and that perhaps Codex had something to offer among the crowd.

By 2020, Iian had a working application delivering two things that stood out. First, a rich text-editor
that made annotation using a graph-based standoff scheme easy. Second, a desktop-like interface users could develop into immersive environments, save as context "snapshots", and then quickly "snap" between across their work.

## Mood

A moodboard helps identify visual elements and discover a general direction for the brand identity. <!-- Prompts
like, "artifacts", "interconnection", and "memory" were used as seed phrases to source the imagery. --> Codex
delivers [aha moments](https://productled.com/blog/how-to-identify-your-products-aha-moment/) to users by connecting
the new and old in surprising ways for example â€“ and we leaned into anachronism as a defining characteristic of Codex's
identity.

## Color

A variety of potential color palettes were sampled from the moodboard. Gold was then selected as a primary brand color
to serve a dual purpose. It built on the idea of Codex being anachronistic (gold is both old and timeless), also
gold, as a neutral color, left room for the many other secondary and tertiary colors Codex needed to render its user-interface.

TODO a new color image

<!-- Black and gold for the primary brand colors allowed for a neutral yet still distinctive primary colors. Brighter
secondary colors are included to demonstrate options for the variety of colors used for Codex's many annotations
features. Together, we get an eclectic, global feel for what Codex represents. -->

(The color palette was derived from the mood of course.)

## Typography

A serif for titles provides a classic and self-assured feel of physical print, while a complimentary sans-serif for body text keeps it clean and contemporary.

## Marketing

A visual identity makes it much easier to build a consistent brand impressions. Here is Codex's new visual identity applied to a product landing page for example.

<!--## Roadmap

Lastly, we modeled the user-experience concepts and how the application might work to support personal knowledge
management, multi-player, and facilitate marketplace exchange of texts and annotation sets.

Talk about "community governance" as a key word.
