# timelion

Complex Complex is a jazz metal trio, part of a raucous, experimental American midwest/east-coast music scene
that began in the late 2000's. The band and I toured through Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and New York together
many times...

I was commissioned sometime around 2008 to produce images for their concept
album, *Timelion*. These images were an attempt to capture the story's conflicts, harmonies, and looseness of
the band performing and recording the album live with nothing but a Fender Rhodes, drum set, and fretless bass â€“
*"absolutely no overdubs!"*.
